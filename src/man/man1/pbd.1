.SH NAME
pbd \- Printf Based Debugger
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpbd\fR [\fIoptions\fR] executable function_name [\fIexecutable_options\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBPBD\fR is a C debugger for Linux systems, which aims to monitor all
global and local variables (of a specific function) and nicely print the
old/new values on the screen, as well as the place where the change has
occurred.
.PP
Focusing on performance, PBD can debug large amounts of variables in a small
amount of time, and when compared to classic debuggers such as GDB, it
achieves a speedup of up to 12x depending on the compiler version, GDB and
workloads used.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-h --help"
Display this information
.IP "-v --version"
Display the PBD version and copyright.
.IP "-s --show-lines"
Prints the line and line number of the code that was changed. By default,
only the line number is printed.
.IP "-l --only-locals"
Monitors only local variables (default: global + local)
.IP "-g --only-globals"
Monitors only global variables (default: global + local)
.IP "-i --ignore-list=var1,var2..."
Given a comma separated sequence of variables names, PBD will ignore them,
whether local or global. Options -i and -w are mutually exclusive.
.IP "-w --watch-list=var1,var2..."
Given a comma separated sequence of variables names, PBD will only watch them,
whether local or global. Options -i and -w are mutually exclusive.
.PP
The following options are for PBD internals:
.IP "-d --dump-all"
Dump all information gathered by the executable: name, size, type, encoding,
location, its breakpoint list and etc...
.SH NOTES
.PP
At the current release (v0.5) PBD have some points that need some hightlights:
.PP
Supported compilers (others might work):
.RS 2
.IP \(em 2
GCC
.IP \(em 2
Clang
.RE
.PP
Architecture, OS and Language support:
.RS 2
.IP \(em 2
x86_64 at the moment
.IP \(em 2
Linux environments
.IP \(em 2
C language
.RE
.PP
DWARF Analysis:
.RS 2
.IP \(em 2
PBD only supports DWARF-2 standard, which means that the user \fB*must*\fR
build the target executable with \fI\-gdwarf\-2\fR flag.
.IP \(em 2
PBD do not support PIE executables, so all the target executables
\fB*should\fR be built with \fI\-no\-pie\fR flag, if the compiler
build PIE executables by default.
.RE
.PP
C Features:
.PP
Currently PBD lacks the following features from C language, and thus, they will
not be analyzed if present:
.RS 2
.IP \(em 2
Enumerations
.IP \(em 2
Structures
.IP \(em 2
Unions
.RE
.SH BUGS
.PP
No known bugs.
